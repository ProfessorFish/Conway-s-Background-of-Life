If it did not set it as your wallpaper, click it if it is in the wallpaper list. If it is not in your wallpaper list, try re-adding it. If that fails, join the discord server by clicking on my name (ProfessorFish) in the credits below.

**Customisation and usage:**
-
You can access the customisation options by clicking on the three dots next to the wallpaper and selecting 'Customise'

There are several options for customisation:

- Live cell colour: The colour of the cells that are "Living" in the simulation
- Dead cell colour: The colour of the cells that are "Dead" in the simulation (You can think of this as a background colour)
- Simulation speed: How often the next frame gets rendered, higher is faster
- Clear board: Removes the board of all cells (Kills them all). Used when creating your own start patterns
- Paused: Pauses the simulation. Used when creating your own start patterns to prevent them from getting instantly started. As soon as this option is unchecked, the simulation starts

**YOU CAN RANDOMISE THE BOARD BY CLICKING ON THE CELL IN THE TOP LEFT CORNER**

*This is in case the board gets boring*
